# Raycase S3 Upload

Why pay for third-party services to store your files when you can upload an image or file to your S3 bucket, get a URL for the file, and use it on the internet?
Usually, third-party services charge $5-10 to store your files, but AWS S3 allows you to store terabytes almost for free ($0.023 per GB). [Check AWS S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

## Instructions

### 1. Create an S3 bucket
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/bucket/create and keep the default configuration but allow public access.

### 2. Create a policy
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/policies/create with access to put objects and set public access to the object:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:PutObjectAcl"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::7f25c230-b972-42c9-8867-72e4cf5eb8ca/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `7f25c230-b972-42c9-8867-72e4cf5eb8ca` with the name of your bucket.

### 3. Create an IAM user
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users/create and attach the created policy to this user.
